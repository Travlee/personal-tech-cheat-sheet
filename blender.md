## Tips

- To make a donut less perfect, goto **Edit Mode**, turn on proportional edit, click a point and then hit G. Now scroll down to narrow the area affected.

- To see smooth objects: in **Object Mode** right click object, with it selected, and click **shade smooth**.

- To smooth mesh: in **Property Window** goto wrench, click **Add Modifier**, then **Subdivision Surface**.

- Select part of an object, hit **Shift + D** to duplicate it, hit **ESC** or **right-click** to cancel movement. Then hit **P** and **Selection** to make it a separate object.

- Add a **Solidify** modifier to icing, increased outset to 1.0 and decreased thickness. Move this modifier above Sub Surface for smooth thickness.

- Turn on snapping to face when moving things: top of the window click **Snap**, then **Face** and **Project Individual Elements**.
